# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

# 22nd July 2015

# run_analysis.R File Description:

# This script will perform the following steps on the UCI HAR Dataset downloaded from 
# https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
# 1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
# 3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names. 
# 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

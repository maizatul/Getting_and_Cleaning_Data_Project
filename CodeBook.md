Getting and Cleaning Data Project 

This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in tidy.txt.

Description

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

run_analysis.R code do the following:

[1] Merges the training and test sets to create one data set, namely train/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt, the result of which is a 10299x561 data frame, as in the original description ("Number of Instances: 10299" and "Number of Attributes: 561"), train/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt, the result of which is a 10299x1 data frame with subject IDs, and train/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt, the result of which is also a 10299x1 data frame with activity IDs.

[2] Reads features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

[3] Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:

Identifiers

subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

WALKING (value number 1): subject was walking during the test
WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value number 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value number 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
SITTING (value number 4): subject was sitting during the test
STANDING (value  number 5): subject was standing during the test
LAYING (value number 6): subject was laying down during the test

[4]Turn activities and subjects labels into factors

[5] Finally, the script creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
